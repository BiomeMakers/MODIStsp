This package is dedicated to the memory of
<a href="https://lbusett.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Lorenzo Busetto</a>.

Lorenzo firmly believed in the open source model: he designed and built
this package in the framework of the activities conducted at the 
Italian National Research Council (CNR-IREA), but releasing it as a free software 
so that anyone can use it for free.
As an expert in using R for spatial analysis and remote sensing applications, 
he actively contributed to the geospatial community.

Lorenzo maintained {MODIStsp} until 21st October 2020, when he suddenly
passed away.
He left an enormous void among his collaborators and friends.
